# Kata15: A Diversion
Think of binary numbers: sequences of 0’s and 1’s. How many n-digit binary numbers are there that don’t have two adjacent 1 bits? For example, here are the three-digit numbers:

__`000 001 010`__ `011` __`100 101`__ `110 111`

Five of the possible eight combinations meet the criteria

What is the number for sequences of length 4, 5, 10, n?

Having worked out the pattern, there’s a second part to the question: can you prove why the relationship exists?

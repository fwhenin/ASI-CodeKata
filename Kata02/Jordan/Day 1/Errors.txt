I initially implemented the recursive binary search thinking that I would simply split the original array and pass the smaller subsets
into the recursive method, but realized that the index of the midpoint would be invalid relative to the original array. Instead, I ended up
passing in a Range object, which represents a set of indices to represent the halves in the original array.

Implementing the recursive behavior for the left half was trivial in my case, but implementation of the right half required some tweaking,
since initially I was off by one and was trying to use the maxElement property.

This one was the toughest out of all of them to write, mainly because I didn't know how else to differentiate it from the previous iterations. 
What led me to this approach was that my previous approaches were all similar in that internally they all returned the midpoint's index
from within the loop / recursive function. Instead, this approach takes a range and halves it until there is only one element left.
